# Sentinel Implementation Roadmap

> Turning architecture into reality.

Version: 0.1

---

# Purpose

This roadmap translates the Sentinel Architecture Specification into an achievable implementation plan.

Rather than attempting to build every subsystem simultaneously, Sentinel will be developed in carefully planned milestones.

Each milestone should produce a usable improvement while laying the foundation for future capabilities.

---

# Development Philosophy

Sentinel should evolve through small, well-tested iterations.

Every milestone should:

* Produce working software
* Improve platform stability
* Expand capabilities
* Preserve architectural integrity
* Remain deployable

Working software is always preferred over unfinished ideas.

---

# Phase 0 — Foundation

## Goal

Create the development environment and project skeleton.

### Deliverables

* Repository structure
* Backend framework
* Frontend framework
* Docker development environment
* Configuration system
* Logging
* Dependency injection
* CI/CD pipeline
* Testing framework

Success Criteria:

A contributor can clone the repository and run Sentinel locally.

---

# Phase 1 — Sentinel Core

## Goal

Build the foundational runtime.

### Deliverables

* Asset Registry
* Event Bus
* Plugin Manager
* Configuration Manager
* Health Service
* API skeleton
* Authentication
* RBAC foundation

Success Criteria:

Sentinel Core starts successfully and exposes a functioning API.

---

# Phase 2 — First Connectors

## Goal

Allow Sentinel to communicate with real infrastructure.

### Initial Connectors

* SSH
* Linux
* Docker
* Proxmox
* Home Assistant
* TrueNAS

Success Criteria:

Sentinel discovers and inventories infrastructure automatically.

---

# Phase 3 — Web Interface

## Goal

Create the first operational user experience.

### Deliverables

* Authentication
* Home Workspace
* Asset Explorer
* Search
* Notifications
* Basic Settings
* User Preferences

Success Criteria:

Users can manage their infrastructure entirely through the web interface.

---

# Phase 4 — Observability

## Goal

Provide operational awareness.

### Deliverables

* Metrics
* Logs
* Events
* Health
* Asset timelines
* Correlation engine

Success Criteria:

Infrastructure health is visible in real time.

---

# Phase 5 — Intelligence

## Goal

Make Sentinel proactive.

### Deliverables

* Knowledge Engine
* AI integration
* Recommendations
* Natural language search
* Operational summaries
* Explainable reasoning

Success Criteria:

Sentinel provides useful operational insight rather than simply displaying data.

---

# Phase 6 — Automation

## Goal

Enable repeatable infrastructure operations.

### Deliverables

* Automation Engine
* Workflow Engine
* Policy Engine
* Scheduled tasks
* Approval workflows

Success Criteria:

Users can automate common operational tasks safely.

---

# Phase 7 — Ecosystem

## Goal

Open Sentinel to the community.

### Deliverables

* Connector SDK
* Plugin SDK
* Documentation
* Templates
* Example projects

Success Criteria:

Community members can build and publish extensions independently.

---

# Phase 8 — Enterprise Features

## Goal

Support larger deployments.

### Deliverables

* Multi-tenancy
* High Availability
* SSO
* Audit enhancements
* Advanced policy controls
* Enterprise connectors

Success Criteria:

Sentinel scales from homelabs to enterprise environments.

---

# Guiding Rules

Throughout development:

* Architecture guides implementation.
* Working software takes priority over perfect software.
* Security is never optional.
* Every feature includes tests.
* Documentation evolves with the code.
* Breaking changes should be minimized.
* Community feedback informs future milestones.

---

# Definition of Done

A feature is considered complete when:

* Code is implemented.
* Tests pass.
* Documentation is updated.
* Security review is complete.
* CI passes.
* The feature is usable.
* The feature aligns with the architecture.

# Success Metrics

Sentinel succeeds when:

* New contributors can become productive quickly.
* New connectors can be created without modifying Sentinel Core.
* Users can manage heterogeneous infrastructure from one platform.
* The community actively contributes plugins and connectors.
* Sentinel remains approachable for homelab users while scaling to enterprise environments.

---

# Closing Statement

The architecture defines what Sentinel can become.

The roadmap defines how we get there.

Progress should be measured not by the number of ideas documented, but by the number of capabilities delivered.

Every milestone moves Sentinel closer to its mission:

**To become the operating platform for modern infrastructure.**
